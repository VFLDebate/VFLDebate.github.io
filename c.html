                    <p>The Battle of Uhud was fought on Saturday, 23 March 625 AD in the valley north of Mount Uhud. The Qurayshi Meccans, led by Abu Sufyan ibn Harb, commanded an army of 3,000 men toward Muhammad's stronghold in Medina. The battle was the only battle throughout the Muslimâ€“Quraysh War in which the Muslims did not manage to defeat their enemy and it came just a year after the Battle of Badr.</p>
